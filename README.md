# Simple Calculator
This is my simple calulator appliation. It supports several of the basic functions of a calculator and evaluates infix expressions with a wide range of operators and operands.

# Goal
The goal of me building this project was to get more experience using the Python programming language, and familierize myself with several of the basic data strucutures in preparation for my data strucutes course. Besides working with these data structures, I 


# Functionality
- Evaluating infix expressions, can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation
- Assigning values to variables
- Evaluating declared variables in infix expressions
- Supports several built in commands (see tutorial)
- Identifying invalid expressions and assignments

# What I learned
- Converting infix expressions to postfix expressions
- Evaluating postfix expressions
- Experience working with simple data structures (lists, stacks, queues)
- Regexes in Python
- Python programming language

# How to get started
In order to run the program, you need to have the following setup/installed:

- Python 3.7

After setting up with Python3, all you have to do to run the calculator is run the main.py file. Hopefully the program doesn't crash when you try to run it. If it's working correctly, the console output should look something like this:
### >>>
It should appear to be blank, however you should be able to type into the console. For instructions on how to use the calculator, please see the tutorial bellow.
